        Full body has been gaining popularity recently. This builds on the science that increasing the frequency you hit a muscle per week will better stimulate growth. Now with full body, you don't need to do your full workout everyday. Instead, you are taking you are splitting it out among the days. (Visit the 
		<a href="pushPullLegs.html" target="_blank">push pull legs page</a>
		to see video on junk volume).
		<br>
		For full body homeworkouts please see the <a href="homeWorkouts.html" target="_blank">home workouts page</a>
		<br>
		Now for full body workouts, I have laid out three different approaches.
		<ul>
			<li>Jeff Nippard Approach: 5 times a week</li>
			<li>Jeremy Ethier Approach: 3 times a week</li>
			<li>BIG3 Approach: 1 time a week, influenced by video I saw by Bart Kwan</li>
		</ul>

	<p>UPDATE: This used to have a video with Bart Kwan showing one of his workouts and essentially you just do the big 3 compound movements (bench press, squat, deadlift) in one day.
		<br>
		I recommend anyone is really busy with work or other goals and can only go to the gym once or twice a week.
